### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[![Background](Blue Futuristic Illustrative Artificial Intelligence Project Presentation.png)

I'm Ivan from New York, and my interests lie in the riveting intersection of mathematics and computer science, where computation meets application. Here, you'll find work ranging from large-scale objected-oriented design, algorithms, theorem-solving, and data exploration and analysis. Each project or repo represents a journey and accumulation of work that displays my growth in all types of skills and topics.

I thrive in the logical challenges inherent in enabling computers to tackle problems that surpass the capabilities of the human mind. I aspire to expand my knowledge and skills in quantitative and data analysis, software and data engineering, and actuarial science. My journey in the world of technology has led me to explore the inner workings of computation theory. With a strong background in both fields, I bring a unique set of problem-solving abilities to my projects, aiming to provide efficient and elegant technical solutions.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Data Analysis project on the spending and user retention of mobile games.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PyTorch as a framework to start my basis of Machine Learning.
